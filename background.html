    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>In my family, I have two brothers, my two parents, and a puppy.</p>
    <p>One of my brothers, is named Jason and he goes to Davidson middle school. My other brother, Isai, is in elementary school.</p>
    <p>I was born in Marin General Hospital located in Greenbrae. I am interested in healthcare, public policy, ethnic and women's studies.</p>
    <p>I like to learn about the last two through books, videos, and attending speeches.</p>
    <h2>Fun Story</h2>
    <p>I went to Oregon and I took a picture with a llama. When I turned around, the llama was aiming for my hat and got it along with some of my hair.</p>
    <p>It was a weird experience, but looking back it is kind of funny.</p>
